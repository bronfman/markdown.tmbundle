# Installation #

To install, you download the .zip file, and after unzipping it, rename the
folder as `markdown.tmbundle`. After that, you can double-click the newly
renamed folder and it should open in TextMate and be installed to the proper
location.

If you are using MultiMarkdown 2.0 (the perl version), then you will want to
use the latest release tagged as version 2 on the [downloads] page.
